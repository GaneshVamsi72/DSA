// A node that was discovered before curr node in DFS, is the ancestor of curr.

// A vertex in an undirected graph is an articulation point (or cut vertex) if removing it (and edges through it) increases the connected components of graph.

// Naive approach: A simple approach is to one by one remove all vertices and see if removal of a vertex causes disconnected graph.

/* Tarjanâ€™s Algorithm: 
The idea is to use DFS (Depth First Search). In DFS, follow vertices in a tree form called the DFS tree. In the DFS tree, a vertex u is the parent of another vertex v, if v is discovered by u. 

In DFS tree, a vertex u is an articulation point if one of the following two conditions is true. 
1. u is the root of the DFS tree and it has at least two children. 
2. u is not the root of the DFS tree and it has a child v such that no vertex in the subtree rooted with v has a back edge to one of the ancestors in DFS tree of u. 
*/

// Time Complexity: O(V + E), For DFS it takes O(V + E) time.

/* 
Why ? For visited neighbour : low[curr] = min(low[curr], disc[neigh]) and not low[curr] = min(low[curr], low[neigh])
Because it fails!!!
